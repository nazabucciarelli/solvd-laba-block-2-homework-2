# 2nd Homework of the Java Test Automation Course (2nd block) - Solvd Laba
This repository stores the 1st homework given by our mentor in the 2nd block of 
the Java Test Automation Course at Solvd Laba. It consists in executing the
MySQL's CRUD statements as INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE and SELECT with multiple
ways of using the joins.

## Explanation

To accomplish the requirements of the homework, I've done each exercise in a
different .sql file with a descriptive name. They are in the src/main/resources
package. Please notice that I've made minor changes in the base hierarchy
(named animals_hierarchy.sql) because I realized of some inconsistencies in the 
schema, and also, to check if the done statements were well done, I had to insert
records manually in most of the tables.

## What did I learn?

Although I already had knowledge about relational databases DDL and DML, 
this homework was very useful to refresh my memory in some concepts, specially
in the join mechanisms that MySQL provides us. Also, I faced some errors when
using the GROUP BY statement, but at last, I could understand how it works.
